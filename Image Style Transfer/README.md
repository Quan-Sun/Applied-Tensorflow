**[Image Style Transfer](https://github.com/Quan-Sun/Learning_Tensorflow/tree/master/Image%20Style%20Transfer)** - A tensorflow implementation of style transfer described in the paper **[Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf)**. It's a very interesting experiment. changing the parameters args_content and args_style in the last cell of notebook to produce your intereting images. I recommend you train this model on colab.
